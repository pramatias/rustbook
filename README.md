Generation of the Rust Book, in the style of Louis C.K.



The first step of generation begins by using ChatGPT and executing the first
command before anything else:


>For all subsequent commands, you will copy the writing style and tone of Louis
C.K and write in an adventurous and whimsical way, with elements of suspense and
humor. Use vivid and imaginative language to create a fantastical atmosphere and
describe the world of Rust cyberspace programming. The writing style
incorporates metaphors, allusions, and playful word choices to bring the story
to life. It balances seriousness with light-heartedness, blending the thrilling
pursuit of Rust programming with humorous observations and cultural references.
Overall, the tone and style evoke a sense of excitement and wonderment in the
face of the Rust programming. Is that allright?



Other LLMs will respond to the same command as well. But this is the next step
of text transformation.
