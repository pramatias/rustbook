    Defining Modules to Control Scope and Privacy

We'll be talking about modules, but first, let me give you a heads-up on the rules to remember while exploring the land of modularity. Imagine these as commandments etched in stone, guiding us through the dark corners of code organization. 

First order of business, people: modules equal organization. Just think of them like fancy filing cabinets holding all your precious data in perfect order. But wait, didn't I also mention paths for naming those organized items? It's like assigning unique addresses to every drawer, creating a code GPS system. Trust me, it works like a charm once you've mastered the art. Let's dig deeper, shall we?

buckle up because today we're gonna learn 'bout some serious coding shizz - specifically the magic behind scopes and privacy. Yep, you heard that right, we're talkin' 'bout makin' certain bits o'code available only to their buddies an' lockin' others away tight like Fort Knox. Ready for this? The key player in our game is the ever-awesome use keyword. This bad boy's like a voodoo incantation that calls a select pal from faraway lands (a.k.a., another scope). It's like sayin', "Yo dude, step into my zone." 

And don't forget the ultimate showoff move called pub. That's right, when ya throw down pub it's like yellin' at the top o'yer lungs, "Lookie here, ev'rybuddy, check dis out! I'm boss ov dis place!" Oh, did I mentionExternal Packages? Them fellahs bring along fresh code pals ta play wit'. Aww yeah, life be sweet fer dem wacky kids from outside town. So stick around an' we'll explore da mysteries ov scopes an' privacy togetha - like code detectives or somethin'.

Code can be such a headache, especially when dealing with stuff like modules and paths. But fear not, 'cause I'm here to make sense of it all! Today, we're gonna tackle the globe operator; now, this little guy might seem harmless, but oh no, he opens up access to EVERYTHING inside those drawers. If you thought the other operators were intense, just wait until you see the global operator in action – it's like cracking open every single folder and letting the entire universe (or should I say the Rust compiler) rummage through its contents. But hey, where there's a great power, comes even greater responsibility, amirite? Keep in mind though, you still need to exercise caution when deploying the globo, or else risk getting yourself lost deep within the bowels of your project's innards. 

And that concludes our tour of operators – hope this cheatsheet helps keep things nice and tidy.

    Modules Cheat Sheet

Welcome to the jungle - err, I mean, the world of Rust crates. Now, what do you think about modularity? Sure makes things easier to maintain, package up, and ship off to others. Just imagine, instead of dumping a huge bucket of spaghetti code on someone's lap, you get to present them with neatly organized bundles of joy. Makes you feel like a gift wrapping ninja or something, huh? Anyways, back to reality: crates consist of a bunch of files working together as a unit, and your job is figuring out how to organize them properly. Crate roots are kinda like the control center for running operations between multiple source directories, while modules deal with subdirectories holding specific functionality. Paths come later to mix it all up and create links between different parts.

So let's dive into the madness of modules, paths, and roots. Okay, imagine we got this big worldwide web of code universes and they all connect together, forming what you might call... a crate. Now, this mother ship has a core brain file, also known as the crate root. Like the command center in the Starship Enterprise, it sets the tone for all the code inhabitants living underneath. There are two types of captains leading their ships: lib crates and bin crates. While libraries land on shores with src/lib.rs files steering the boats, executables navigate life with main crates and src/main.rs as their first mates. Don't worry about getting lost in space, though, cuz I'm here to map out each planet and asteroid between the cosmos of crates and their infinite path possibilities.

So, picture this: You've got one big ass code universe called the crate root, and it's essentially the nucleus of your code kingdom. This place holds the key to all your modules. You know, like different parts of your codebase, kinda like distinct gardens or kitchens. Just like cooking a delicious dinner, you'll have certain ingredients spread across various spots while maintaining order and organization. Same goes for the code game - modules get scattered throughout three locations:

1)Inside the crate root itself via curly braces, replacing semicolons
2)Specialized files: src/garden.rs or src/garden/mod.rs
3)Submodules placed anywhere outside the crate root go hog wild into additional folders and files for specific modules or submodules, and yes indeed, you gotta use curly brackets to note each section's existence. Yep, you read that correctly. What did you expect from the land of modules and paths - consistency? Ha! Good luck with that. Oh well, it's worth learning these ropes since nobody enjoys rewriting code multiple times due to misunderstood operator behavior. Stay tuned for more laughs, and remember, never overestimate the importance of knowing basic concepts clearly understood by people who happen upon them daily.

We're talking now about how to navigate through code now, specifically how to locate your damn types and functions with those darn paths.

Think of it this way: imagine your code is a city full of people and buildings. Each module is like a neighborhood and every function or struct is someone wandering around that particular area. So, when you wanna find 'em, you need a map - the path - telling ya precisely where they are.

Anyway, let me break down how this works with examples. Let's say you made a Garden Vegetables module (which you should cuz we Rustaceans love us some greens!) with some fancy Asparagus types inside. These sweet little greenies would live at that path CrateRoot::GardenVegetables::Asparagus

BUT WAIT! Let's say your Asparagus boys need some privacy since it's not cool to walk naked in public. That's why paths come into play. They keep stuff private between modules unless yah invite em' in via pub mod. It's like tellin' yer brother how ripped his bod looks compared to yours even though he ain't workin' out lately either... Anyway! Don't worry, once you make a module public? Everyone sees him shirtless strutting around town, proud AF of himself :D

And dat's it! With some practice and maybe some therapy for my bad jokes here, ya good folk should prolly start thinkin' less often 'bout those damn paths!

 The Rust dev crew brought us the use token, just like the magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat. It's like giving yourself superpowers or something. One little word, and you'll feel like freakin' Tony Stark in front of an autocorrect machine gone mad. Just write "use crate::garden::vegetables::asparagus;" or whatever random path you want, hit enter, and voila! Code gets shortened like a stray cat. From there on out, it's nothing but smooth sailing, thanks to that little buddy named asparagus.

So, let's step deeper into this burrow and spill tea with some crate brews. We've got our homeboy crate called "backyard". Whoa, looks like he's rocking a bikini top situation here (just files, no directories underneath). What's inside his humble abode? Aww yeah, check it out, people:

backyard
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    ├── garden
    │   └── vegetables.rs
    ├── garden.rs
    └── main.rs

t's a cozy treehouse! Now, pay attention 'cause we're zooming through different levels o' depth in our journey. First off, Main Man: er, that would be main.rs - our epicenter. And yes, that's exactly right, folks! This particular folder acts as the beginning point of our entire adventure. Plus, it contains an important message (and trust me, I am the king of hidden messages):

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust

use crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus;

pub mod garden;

fn main() {
    let plant = Asparagus {};
    println!("I'm growing {:?}!", plant);
}

```

You already know the deal by now: the power of "use" and his ability to grant wishes. Or shortcuts rather, like calling Uber Eats when you're too lazy to cook dinner. Think about it: if someone's offering you premade mac and cheese, wouldn't you go for it? But what about opening doors to other dimensions first? Boom, welcome Garden Boy! He brings along his own secret society of plants hiding behind locked gates labeled "src/garden.rs". 

Now, we're divin' deep into the realm of gardening, where we can harvest some delectable treasures.

Filename: src/garden.rs

```rust

pub mod vegetables;

```
Pub mod vegetables. Yeah, it sounds catchy like some kinda pub night vibe, don't cha think? Well, buddies, lemme tell ya something juicy. That phrase actually conjures up some magical stuff hidden beneath the surface of Rustlandia. It signifies an open door policy for all who want to join the fun of discovering crate::garten::vegetables::Asparagus; pretty sweet for all those seeking knowledge on these botanical wonders, innit?

```rust

#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct Asparagus {}

```
Just picture these fellas hanging out in src/garden/, sipping wine 'n chatting bout how they can create magic within their worlds. Then comes the moment of truth. BAM! They present their latest brainchild to the audience: the glorious struct Asparagus standing tall in front of them, sportin' the #[derive(Debug)] badge on its sleeveless tank. And voilà, the applause rolls in as they declare its debut via that friendly use fella, welcoming even more guests to the scene.

Now get this, pals. That's not all. Once src/garden/ gate opens wide enough to embrace newcomers, it also exposes the main() function's shenanigans, lettin' everyone see the boy wonder's plan to print "I'm growing {:?}!", pushin' buttons on behalf of Mr. Asparagus himself. Oh, and did I mention our lad's got a green thumb? Toldja this dude could grow anything, didn't I? Haha!

    Grouping Related Code in Modules

Alright, let's talk about modules! They're like the organizers of a code party.
You know, like when you throw a party, you gotta organize stuff, right? You want
all the snacks in one place, the drinks in another, and the dance floor, well,
you need a space for that too. That's exactly what modules do in Rust.

So, we're gonna create a library crate, and it's gonna be all about a fancy
restaurant. Oh, la la! We're gonna have functions that make this restaurant
awesome, but for now, we'll just focus on the structure, not the nitty-gritty
details.

Now, in the restaurant biz, there's a front of house and a back of house. The
front of house is where all the customers are, where the magic happens! You've
got hosts seating people, servers taking orders and payments, and bartenders
making delightful drinks.

On the other hand, we've got the back of house, where all the kitchen action is!
This is where the chefs and cooks work their culinary magic. We've got
dishwashers cleaning up the mess (someone's gotta do it!), and managers taking
care of all the admin stuff.

Picture your Rust project as if it were a dinner party you're throwing. And I mean a real fancy dinner party where everything needs to be perfectly planned down to the smallest detail. Just think about it, without proper modularization, your entire project would turn into one gigantic mess of codes and chaos - kinda like when someone throws a party but forgets to set up any games or activities to keep guests entertained. But don't worry, Rust comes equipped with Modularization, which acts as your personal assistant and helps create separate "domains" for different parts of your project.

Take a glimpse at crates libraries, where you can see all these beautiful objects organized into modules - public and private ones included.

Modules are like little universes housing related functionalities under one roof. Sure, guests only get to interact with public items visible to them. Meanwhile, we keep those precious internal affairs tucked away safely in private land until they are ready to meet new faces. Oh yeah, think of it more like exclusive invite-only events rather than open bar parties welcoming anyone.

What's even better is that you retain full control over who gets an invite based on the dependencies needed between various crates - much like choosing selectively who makes it onto your personal guest list or not! If some components aren't necessary right now, simply mark 'em unused until future expansion plans arise.

It's time to start building our very own restaurant crate using Rust! The name of the game here is modularity, baby, and it's like giving every dish its own designated space instead of slopping together some random ingredients in a single pot. You know how it goes, you're at a dinner party and suddenly grandma's famous meatballs are rubbin' shoulders next to your kid cousin's macaroni art installation, right? That'd never fly in a five-star joint!

Well, no need to freak out cuz we got Rust and its nifty crate system to help us keep everything sane and orderly. All it takes is a simple cargo new command to whip up our latest creation: restaurant. Nice, huh? Don't sweat it if ya don't recall the exact syntax off top of yer head either; rust has its fingers deep in Google's silicone heart so jus type in somethin' along the lines of "how do i install _______rust version ________" and ya might find yourself accidentally learning how ta search stuff online (I sure hope that was an easy trick for all ya).

Filename: src/lib.rs

```rust

mod front_of_house {
    mod hosting {
        fn add_to_waitlist() {}

        fn seat_at_table() {}
    }

    mod serving {
        fn take_order() {}

        fn serve_order() {}

        fn take_payment() {}
    }
}
```
Listing 7-1: A front_of_house module containing other modules that then contain
functions

See what we did there? We created a module called front_of_house. It's like the
entrance to our restaurant, where all the action starts. Inside this module, we
can have more modules, just like nesting dolls. So we've got hosting and serving
modules within front_of_house.
Our crate's gotta have a main lib.rs function doin' whatever magic our customers demand.

Beyond front_of_house lies the true treasure trove awaitin' hungry eyes! Modules like hosting and serving provide the fine service each position demands, complete with brand spankin' functions like add_to_waitlist, seat_at_table, take_order, and serve_orders. Feast yer eyes upon such beauty! Sure looks good enough to eat, right?

But hold on tight, because there’s even more to discover underneath the surface than meets the eye. Remember how I mentioned modules earlier? Well, they come packed full o’ goods too, my friends. From humble beginnings like hosting and serving to the rich buffet of structs, enums, traits, and even functions galore. And guess what? They don’t share these babies publicly unless invited to join the party. Private by default like a carefully guarded family recipe passed down through generations. Now THAT’S some quality control right there, wouldn’t you say?

So there ya go – crates as apps, main() as your anchor point between them all, and an everlasting love story between private + public = functional balance. Fascinated yet intrigued? Thought so.

Let's take another look at modules shall we? Imagine you're running a cozy little shop (code included). Without proper organization, it turns into a hot mess of confusion (think, throwing pots 'n' pans drawers). But fear not! Enter: the magical world of modular coding. Like having compartments and labels for each item. Toss away that cluttered kitchen drawer syndrome! Keep everything tidy.

Now let's scale it up to real-world size: multiple people are coming together to craft something amazeballs. Instead of passing notes via snail mail or carrier pigeons, we unleash digital technomagic at its finest: file sharing baby! Can't find what yah looking fer? Modules gotcher back.

Now, before moving on to crate roots (groovy name). Like Rome, crates ain't built in one day. Main attraction(s) consist of mainfest Destiny + lib manifest destiny. Gotsta add 'em in the correct order, innit? But who cares once we reach critical mass? It becomes bigger than us mere mortals (hellooo crateroid!) Crate rootin', lib rootin' every night!

Listing 7-2 shows the module tree for the structure in Listing 7-1.

crate
 └── front_of_house
     ├── hosting
     │   ├── add_to_waitlist
     │   └── seat_at_table
     └── serving
         ├── take_order
         ├── serve_order
         └── take_payment

Listing 7-2: The module tree for the code in Listing 7-1

Well remember Listing 7-2? Yeah, that ol' thing? Turns out it's kind of a big deal. It's like a freakin' Russian nesting doll situation, only in code land. Each module has a parent-child relationship. Like when "hosting" was spawned by "front_of_house", it said to itself, "I wanna be just like mommy!" Boom, instant family affair. Then, "hosting" went and had some sibling action, birthing "seating_station". You know what they say, family always comes first, amiritefolks? #ModulsRUs

But seriously though, it's like an org chart for code nerds (aka me and probably ya'). That way you don't get lost in this endless sea of zeros and ones. Modules help us find our way around the file system jungle like a GPS for your codebase. Ah yes, taming the wild beast known as software development. Code monkeys beware. We level up our dev game using moduls and stuff gets legit organized AF. It's like some sick symphony of modul madness. I'm here to tell you, if you want your code to sing like a rockstar, then hit them high notes with moduls, people. They may not guarantee you fame and fortune, but they sure do bring some major order to your digital domain. So, stick around, folks, cause next time, we dive deeper into the crazy labyrinth that is the module tree.
